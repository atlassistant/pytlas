pytlas is an open-source ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¬ **python 3** assistant library built for
people and made to be super easy to setup and understand.

Its goal is to make easy to **map natural language sentences** to
**python function handlers**. It also manages a conversation with the help of
a finite state machine to enable back and forth communications between a user
and its agent.

Ever wanted to develop your own Alexa, Siri or Google Assistant and host it
yourself? This is possible!

.. warning::

    **pytlas** being a library, it does not handle speech recognition and synthesis. It only handles text inputs. If you want it to be able to interact with the voice, you must write a :ref:`client` which will call the library internally.
