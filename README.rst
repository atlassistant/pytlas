An open-source ü§ñüí¨ Python 3 assistant library built for people and made to be super easy to setup and understand.

**pytlas** translates natural language sentence into python skills you can easily define yourself. It makes it really easy to develop your own Google Assistant, Alexa or whatever but runs on **your device** with **your trusted code** and **no connection** to obscure servers.

üåä Want to get your feet wet? Have a look at the `example/skills` folder to see how it works!

üìö Want to go further and develop your own skill? Let's visit the `latest documentation <https://pytlas.readthedocs.io>`_ and share your work!
