An open-source ü§ñüí¨ python 3 assistant library built for people and made to be super easy to setup and understand.

**pytlas** translates natural language sentence into python skills you can easily define yourself.

I first started to develop `atlas <https://github.com/atlassistant/atlas>`_ but I have finally decided to develop a library that everyone could embed in their own program with simple python code.

Want to get your feet wet? Have a look at the `example/skills` folder to see how it works!
