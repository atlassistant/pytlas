‚ö†Ô∏è **You're reading the develop README.** For the last published version documentation, `please click here <https://github.com/atlassistant/pytlas/tree/43bda4ea9936c414a77aafdc803144dcbaa50672>`_.

An open-source ü§ñüí¨ python 3 assistant library built for people and made to be super easy to setup and understand.

I first started to develop `atlas <https://github.com/atlassistant/atlas>`_ but I have finally decided to develop a library that everyone could embed in their own program with simple python code.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation is being actively re-written to `https://pytlas.readthedocs.io <https://pytlas.readthedocs.io>`_, that's the next big step before the V3 release!

Creating a skill
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Skill are reusable piece of code that you can share with others and do the actual job. You can have a skill that fetch weather forecasts, another one that talks with your home connected components, that's entirely up to you!

Skills are self-contained and composed of 3 specific components:

- Training data: examples of how to trigger specific intents from natural language, defined in a tiny Domain Specific Language not tied to a particular NLU engine,
- Translations: simple key/value pair used by your skill for different languages,
- Intent handlers: Python code called when a specific intent has been parsed by `pytlas`

Have a look at the `example/skills` folder to see how it works.

Testing
-------

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install -e .[snips,test]
  $ python -m nose --with-doctest -v --with-coverage --cover-package=pytlas
